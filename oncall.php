    <p class="stext"> "Olympic On Call" is a new service currently being offered for the 
        upcoming school year. Morning and afternoon pick ups are being
        offered on an ala-carte basis for central location stops.  If your 
        student is in need of a ride, <strong>phone Olympic to see if we have a seat
        available.</strong>  If a seat is available, fill out a <a class="ptext" href="downloads/MinorLiabilityWaiver.pdf">Minor Liability Waiver</a>.  This Waiver
        must be received prior to the student riding on Olympic. Once the Waiver 
        is received, your driver will be notified to pick up your student and 
        transport them to or from school.  This service is offered on a daily 
        basis for any student attending Bradford Preparatory School, Corvian Community School, Lake Norman Charter, Mountain
        Island Charter School or Pine Lake Preparatory.  Current families who ride Olympic can also 
        utilize this service as an add-on to their existing plan.  This is a 
        great opportunity for those families who need a ride to school just 
        once-in-a-while or as a last minute need.  The fee for the service is 
        $5.00 each way.  Sibling discounts do not apply to this offer.
