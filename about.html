   <p class="ptext">My name is Lori Pasewaldt and I am the owner/operator of Olympic Transportation, LLC.  Olympic is a Huntersville, North Carolina, based business which specializes in providing families with an alternative transportation choice to local area charter, private and public schools.  As a mother of two children who attend a charter school, I can fully understand and indeed sympathize with the current plight of local families in managing the daily struggle of getting their children to and from school.  The pursuit of academic excellence for our children is a common family priority.  Olympic Transportation was built on the firm belief that the inability to get children to and from a school of choice should not be a burden borne alone.  Car pool arrangements often times cannot work to the mutual benefit of those involved.  The juggling of differing family priorities with after school activities lends additional stress to the situation.  Olympic offers a way to alleviate some of that stress and allow a family to better utilize and enjoy the time not spent in car pool lines and traffic on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="ptext prepend-top">We currently service the areas of Huntersville, Cornelius, and Davidson and offer either central location pick-up or door-to-door pick up and drop off.  Arrangements are made on a reservation basis only and are flexible enough to allow monthly, weekly, or daily ala carte services.  Student riders are transported in a safe, clean environment in a passenger van which holds 14 students.  All seats have seat belts and regular scheduled maintenance is performed on the vehicle as suggested by the manufacturer.  Olympic only utilizes licensed and certified drivers who have been background checked, drug tested, fingerprint searched and are fully licensed to drive. </p>
